# Popular Moves Part 1 and 2 Project Code

## Overview
The user is shown a grid of movie thumbnails, which they can sort
by either "Most Popular", "Highest Rated", or "Favorites." Clicking
on a movie thumbnail displays a page with the movie's details. The
user can also choose whether to add the movie to their favorites.

## How to use
This project needs an API key for The Movie Database API.
Once obtained, the key will need to be added to the "API_KEY"
field variable within "/utilities/NetworkUtils.java."
